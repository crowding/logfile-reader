"logfile" is a parser which converts my psychophysics experiment log
files (in an ad-hoc format based around evaluable Matlab expressions)
into a series of statements evaluable in R (by the function
translator.R in the parent directory. Thus, it translates a subset of
Matlab syntax into R.  It is written using flex and bison for parser
generation parser.

"strbuilder" has some simple routines to build long strings out of
linked lists joining smaller strings, and is used by logfile.
