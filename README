`logfile` is a parser which converts my psychophysics experiment log
files (in an ad-hoc format based around evaluable Matlab expressions)
into a series of statements evaluable in R. Thus, it translates a
subset of Matlab syntax into R.  It is written using flex and bison
for parser generation.

`readR.R` uses logfile, then evaluates the result to build data frames.

`strbuilder` implements a dumb string-list data structure used by
`logfile`.
